## Entry Points for Contributors

**Start anywhere. Fork freely. No permission needed.**

### Story Entry Points

- Write a scene from the perspective of a high-grade slave artisan (an *empolos* or sculptor) who despises both the citizen masters and the unskilled *thetes*, exploring their precarious social limbo.
- Draft a monologue by Pericles or a similar statesman, justifying the use of League funds and mass labour for the Parthenon as a necessary civic and spiritual project.
- Create a 'found document'—a worn scrap of a foreman's ledger, a charcoal sketch on a pottery shard by a labourer, or a coded message passed between workers.
- Write a myth or parable invented and told by the workers at night, re-casting the gods as cruel overseers or the Titans as the first labourers.

### Technical Entry Points

- Build an interactive map of the Acropolis worksite, tagging locations with audio clips of different sounds (chisels, groaning ropes, foreman's shouts, philosophical debate) to create an immersive sonic class landscape.
- Create a 'Burden Calculator' that visualizes the cumulative weight lifted by Nikias and his crew over the novel's timeline, translating it into modern equivalents (e.g., number of warships, stacks of currency).
