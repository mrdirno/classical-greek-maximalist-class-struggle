  "cover_prompt": "A colossal, unfinished marble column lies cracked and toppled across a quarry floor, its immense weight crushing a simple wooden abacus and scattering clay tokens, while the ghostly, translucent forms of idealized gods look on from the clouds above, indifferent. The scene is set in a sun-blasted Greek quarry at dusk, with exhausted, sinewy laborers in the shadows, their backs scarred and tools discarded, as one young man silently carves a tiny, defiant symbol into the base of the fallen stone. In the hyper-detailed, classically-infused and socially-charged style of painter Anselm Kiefer, with the monumental texture and tragic grandeur of Thomas Cole's ruins. Book cover framing, centered and monumental composition, low-angle shot looking up at the fallen column as if from the perspective of the workers. Dramatic chiaroscuro lighting with long, deep shadows cutting across the marble, a palette of bone-white stone, ochre dust, bruised twilight purple, and the warm, dying ember glow of the horizon. masterpiece, best quality, ultra detailed, intricate details, professional composition, sharp focus, 8k resolution, flux dev."
